In the normal Estimated Weighted Averages, in the initial phase, the values of V_1 and V_2, for example, are way lower than the actual values of θ_1 or θ_2, so to correct that, we use Bias Correction method.

What you do is that, instead of taking the v_t as it is, youdo  this:

v_t/(1-β^t)

Where t is the current day you are on (from the perspective of the previous example).
