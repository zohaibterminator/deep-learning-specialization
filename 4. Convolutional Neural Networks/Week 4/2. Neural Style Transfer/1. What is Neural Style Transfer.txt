What is Neural Style Transfer? Lets say you have an image of the Stanford University, and you want to recreate the picture in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night painting. What Neural Style Transfer allows you to do is generate this new image of the Stanford University in the style of Van Gogh's painting. In order to describe how you can implement this yourself, I'm going to use C to denote the content image, S to denote the style image, and G to denote the image you will generate.

In order to implement Neural Style Transfer, you need to look at the features extracted by ConvNet at various layers, the shallow and the deeper layers of a ConvNet. Before diving into how you can implement a Neural Style Transfer, lets try and get a better intuition about what all these layers of a ConvNet really computing.
