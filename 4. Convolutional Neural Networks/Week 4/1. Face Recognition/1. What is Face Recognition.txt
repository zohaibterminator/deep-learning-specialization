First, let's start by going over some of the terminology used in face recognition. In the face recognition literature, people often talk about face verification and face recognition. This is the face verification problem which is if you're given an input image as well as a name or ID of a person and the job of the system is to verify whether or not the input image is that of the claimed person. So, sometimes this is also called a one to one problem where you just want to know if the person is the person they claim to be. So, the recognition problem is much harder than the verification problem.

In the face recognition problem, you have a database of, lets say, K persons, and given an image of the person, output the ID of the person if it's in the database. This is a one to K problem, because now you dont have to verify a person given a single ID, you now have to verify the person given K no. of IDs. Now, let's say you have a verification system that is 99% accurate, and there are 100 persons in the database (so K=100), so if you apply the same face recognition algorithm on each of those 100 people, it will work fine for 99 people, but it may not recognize or incorrectly recognize the 100th person. So, if you have a database of a 100 persons, and if you want an acceptable recognition error, you might actually need a verification system with maybe 99.9 or even higher accuracy before you can run it on a database of 100 persons and still have a high chance of getting it incorrect. It turns out one of the reasons that it is a difficult problem is that you need to solve a one shot learning problem.
