To understand ML strategy, lets look at an example. You have trained a cat classifier, and it is giving you 90% accuracy. You decide that you should improve your NN. Some ideas to improve your NN that you thought of are:

1. Collect more data
2. Collect more diverse training set (cats in more poses, or more diverse negative examples)
3. Train your algorithm longer with GD
4. Use a different optimizing algorithm entirely (for example, Adam)
5. Try bigger or smaller network
etc, etc...

There can be many ways to choose how to improve your NN, but if you choose poorly and spend a lot of time, say 6 months, working on that idea, only to realize that that didnt do any good.

In this course, we will learn some effective strategies to analyze your ML problem, that will point you in a direction of the most promising things to try, and safely discard the rest.
