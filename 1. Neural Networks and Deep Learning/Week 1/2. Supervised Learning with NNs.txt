In supervised learning you have some input X, and you learn a function to map it to an output Y. Some of the most lucrative appication of DL is online advertisement, in which you input an Ad that the website is thinking of showing you and some information about the user, the NN have become very accurate at predicting whether you will click on an Ad. Speech recog, autonomous driving, photo tagging, etc are also a very popular application of DL.

Different types of NNs are more suited to different applications. For house price prediciton and Online advertisement, a standard NN architecture is enough for the job. But for anything related to image, a Convolutional NN is preferred. Or if there is sequence data involved like Audio, or text, where something is done over time or have a temporal aspect to it, Recurrent NNs are used.

There are applications of NNs that use both structured and unstructured data. Structured data mean databases of data or data in tabular form, where each feature has a very well-defined meaning. Unstructured data refers to audio, images, text, etc. Where features might be a value of a pixel. COmputers have been historically been very bad with unstructured data, in contrast to humans. But NN have given computers the ability to understand with unstructured data.
