Lets take a function f(a) = 3a. So, it's just a straight line. To get intuition about derivatives, let's look at a few points on this function. Let say that a is equal to two. In that case, f(a), which is equal to three times a, is equal to six. So, if a is equal to two, then f(a) will be equal to six. Let's say we give the value of a just a little bit of a nudge. So now, let's say a is 2.001. Now, f(a), is equal to three times that. So, it's 6.003. If we plot this, what we see is that if a is nudged to 0.001 to the right, then f(a) goes up by 0.003. The amounts that f(a), went up is three times as big as the amount that a is nudged to the right. So, we're going to say that, the slope or the derivative of the function f of a, at a equals to or when a is equals two to the slope is three. The term derivative basically means slope. More formally, the slope is defined as the height divided by the width. So, this is 0.003 over 0.001, and the fact that the slope is equal to three or the derivative is equal to three, just represents the fact that when you nudge a to the right by 0.001, by tiny amount, the amount at f of a goes up is three times as big as the amount that you nudged it, that you nudged a in the horizontal direction. So, that's all that the slope of a line is. If we take another value of a, we will see that the derivative of the function is still 3. So, this is a property of the derivative. No matter what value of a you take, the derivative of f(a) remains 3, meaning the value of f(a) always goes up by 3 times.
