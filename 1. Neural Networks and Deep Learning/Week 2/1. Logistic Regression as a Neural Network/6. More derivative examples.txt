Lets look at a more complex function, f(a) = a^2. If a=2, f(a) is 4. But if a=2.001, f(a) will be approximately equal to 4.004, not exactly. But we will say it is equal. So, we can say that the derivative of f(a) at a=2 is 4, because f(a) went up by 4 times as much, when the value of a was increases slightly. Similarly, we take a=5, then f(a) is 25. But, when we bump the value of a by a little amount and make it 0.001, f(a) becomes 25.010. So we see that by increasing the value of a by 0.001, the f(a) goes up by 0.01, so that means, when we increased the value of a by 0.001, f(a) goes up 10 times as much, so that d/da(f(a)) = 10, when a=5. When we draw the triangle of width and height on the plot of function f(a) at different points corresponding to different values of a, we will see that the ratio of heigh/width ratio of the triangle is very different at different points of the curve. When you will open a calculas text book, you will see that the d/da(a^2) is 2a, which is consistent to what we have seen so far. When a=2, d/da(a^2) = 4, and when a=5, d/da(a^2) = 10. This means, every time you will increase the value of a by 0.001 amount, then f(a) will go up by 2*a.
