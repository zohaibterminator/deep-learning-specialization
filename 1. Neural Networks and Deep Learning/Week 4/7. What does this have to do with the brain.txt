Spoiler alert: Not a whole lot.

How neurons work inside a human brain is still not known today, but since originally DL started out as sort of an experiment to mimic the behavior of neurons in the human brain, it is moved far away from that idea. But still it's kind of a "cool" thing to say so you hear it a lot in media. Even though DL are very good at learning very flexible and complex functions and generating X to Y mappings, just know that they are not related to the workings of neurons in the human brain.
